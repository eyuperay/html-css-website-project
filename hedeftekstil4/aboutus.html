          Hedef Tekstil was founded in 2002 in the famous city of Ödemiş, known for its local silk and unique silk weaving culture. However, in response to market needs and trends, we decided to diversify our product offerings in 2020 and we began producing bedding sets in addition to the fabrics we have always produced. With our bedding sets, we aim to provide our customers with a wider range of products and prioritize quality and customer satisfaction.
